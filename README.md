The topic of my Thesis for the Master of Science: Engineering (Robotics) program for the University of West Florida, this project aims to program an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to identify and subsequently follow an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to navigate areas of unknown traversibility (as in, unknown from the UGV's perspective).

Platforms Used:
- UGV: JetHexa (Hiwonder)
- UAV: CoDrone EDU (Robolink)

ROS:
