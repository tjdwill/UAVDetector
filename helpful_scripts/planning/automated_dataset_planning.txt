What's required for an image label (YOLOv5)
    - Bounding box
    - label

Info:
    - CoDroneEDU (height -> 35mm; width -> 138mm)
        - w:h ~= 3.943
        


Program:
    - Command-line parsing
        - Desired File Name Prefix
        - Output Directory
        - (optional) Desired num of leading zeros.
        - (optional) ArUCO tag dictionary
    - Capture images via camera
    - Analyze each image for the ArUCo tag. 
    - Associate ArUCo tag with some depth based on tag area (?)
        - Nope. Try associating width of bounding box with height of tag (because height of small tag is ~1:1 with height of drone)
    - Draw requisite bounding box (for testing)
        - Calculate center of detection
        - Calculate requisite width from height
        - Calculate bounding box points
        - Draw BBox onto image and display.
    - File Operations
        - Check to see if file exists in directory already; Modify output file name prefix as a result.
        - Generate file names (JPG and TXT)
        - Generate label .txt file
            - Format: <Class index> <center-x> <center-y> <width of bounding box> <height of bounding box>
                - Only include the numbers; no '<>'
                - Coordinates and dimensions are normalized between 0 and 1 as percentages of image dimensions.
